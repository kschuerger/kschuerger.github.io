<p>We can see that there is a positive correlation between IBU and ABV. We can see a big cluster around 5% ABV, and we predict that these are regular 12 ounces of beers which, according to NIAAA in the U.S., contain between 4-7% ABV, with the average being 5%. Anything above estimates to be malt liquor which averages to be 7% ABV. It is worth noting that correlation does not equal causation. Next, we decided to compare ABV and IBU by Ale and IPA. We can see that the majority of Ales have low ABV and IBU while the majority of IPAs have high ABV and IBU. Budweiser has average 5% ABV and 7 IBU; therefore, we may carefully suggest focusing on products with ABVs within range of 5.6 to 5.8% and IBUs of 19 to 64. This range might be more competitive in the existing market.</p>

The accuracy for predicting IPA with internal cross-validation based on ABV and IBU was found to be 81.68%, the specificity was 75.48%, and the sensitivity was 85.36%.</p>
